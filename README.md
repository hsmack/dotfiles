# Dotfiles

Simple dot files for my VPS server setups.  At this writing, I only use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS servers.
The philosophy is to use the default setup, and add minimal files.

## Is this opionated software?
Yes it is.  Any config file can be opinionated.
My vimrc setup is to tab with 2 spaces.

## Why is this a git repo?

I want to be able to execute a single command to "bootstrap" install a new system with all the basic dotfiles and configs.
